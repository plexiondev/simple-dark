## Installing

There is a very simple and lightweight installation process for the theme itself. Before we start, ensure you have **BetterDiscord installed**, you can download it [here](https://betterdiscord.app/) if not. 

1. Once done, head over to the Releases sidebar and grab the latest release.
2. Drop this file into your BetterDiscord themes folder (eg. `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
3. Head into your Themes settings (in Discord) and apply **Simple Dark**
