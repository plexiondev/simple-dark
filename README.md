# Simple Dark for Discord

A simple, dark and minimal theme for Discord. Featuring a nice blue-black colour scheme along with a minor re-design in parts of the core interface.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

Following Discord's recent changes, all BetterDiscord themes will no longer work and will require updating from the developers. They've basically renamed the majority of the classes used in the CSS for themes meaning nothing will work. If I find the time to update this theme I will - but for the time being, unfortunately the theme will not work as intended. - 11/01/2022

## Installing

There is a very simple and lightweight installation process for the theme itself. Before we start, ensure you have **BetterDiscord installed**, you can download it [here](https://betterdiscord.app/) if not. 

1. Once done, head over to the Releases sidebar and grab the latest release.
2. Drop this file into your BetterDiscord themes folder (eg. `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
3. Head into your Themes settings (in Discord) and apply **Simple Dark**
